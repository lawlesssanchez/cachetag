CacheTag™ — A Hashtag-Triggered, Just-In-Time Retrieval Layer for AI

By Dena Lawless (Author)
with Abe Jarrett (Contributing Originator)

Author's note: CacheTag™ is a deliberately simple, energy-efficient AI retrieval pattern designed to stop large models from regenerating the same answers over and over. It replaces wasteful compute cycles with lightweight, hashtag-triggered knowledge capsules that are fast, stable, and easy to govern.

CacheTag™ is a lightweight, hashtag-driven retrieval cache that returns curated Top-5 Q&A “HashPacks™” instead of regenerating answers from scratch. It removes the need for embeddings, vector databases, or indexing. Everything operates at the natural-language layer.

When combined with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), CacheTag becomes a governed, secure, just-in-time recall architecture for enterprise AI systems.
