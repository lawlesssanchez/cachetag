CacheTag™ — A Hashtag-Triggered, Just-In-Time Retrieval Layer for AI

By Dena Lawless (Author)
with Abe Jarrett (Contributing Originator)

CacheTag™ is a lightweight, hashtag-driven retrieval cache that returns curated Top-5 Q&A “HashPacks™” instead of regenerating answers from scratch. It removes the need for embeddings, vector databases, or indexing — everything operates at the natural-language layer.

When combined with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), CacheTag becomes a governed, secure, just-in-time recall architecture for enterprise AI systems.
